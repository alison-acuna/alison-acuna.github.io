        I love learning.  As a student coach at InsideTrack, I have the opportunity to support students at Arizona State University and Brandman University in navigating their Master's degree.  After 5 years of helping others take the next steps in their education, I was anxious to take the next step in mine.

        I am drawn to web development because there are always new things to learn.  I am also drawn to the opportunity to create and improve on that creation.  Web development is an industry filled with interesting challenges.  Since I take a lot of satisfaction from doing a hard thing well, web development is a really appealing field in which to focus my learning.

        Prior to entering a development bootcamp, I spent a year learning HTML, CSS, Wordpress, Javascript, Python and Django independently using Treehouse and CodeAcademy.  I am good at teaching myself to code.  I decided to enter a bootcamp to learn faster and get feedback about my code.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I approach the mid-point of my developer bootcamp, I am looking for a back end internship with a June start date.  I would like to contribute to projects in Python and Django.  Take a look around my portfolio and contact me to learn more.
