          After years of customer-centric work in higher education, I&#8217;m excited to work in roles that better utilize both my technical skills and my strengths in communication and relationship management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in tech because there are endless opportunities to learn and solve interesting problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tech is also a natural extension of my interests and previous education.  My BA is in Rhetoric: Communication and Logic.  I started my career in higher ed administration - a field that is rooted in communication.  Although I enjoyed the work, I also longed for opportunities to engage my analytical side.  I found projects within my team that allowed me to problem solve.  For example, I crafted new ways for my coworkers to interact with our database that would increase our ability hit goals.  Moving fully into tech allows me to work in an area that engages my love of logic, problem solving, and analytical thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am perpetually learning, and am confident in my ability to master whatever crosses my path. I won a company-wide award for excellence within 3 months of being hired at InsideTrack which demonstrates the speed with which I pick up new skills.  Prior to starting at Code Guild, I studied front end web development through self-study and produced several projects for myself and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proud of graduating from PDX Code Guild and also the way I pursued my education.  I entered the night class at PDX Code Guild while working full time at InsideTrack.  This demonstrates my drive and willingness to devote personal time to learn new concepts.   During this time, I also joined the ACT-W: Women in Technology Conference planning team to further my emersion into Portland&#8217;s tech community.
